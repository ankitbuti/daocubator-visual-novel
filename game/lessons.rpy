    "equal_split": (
        "THE EQUAL SPLIT TRAP",
        "Equal splits are chosen to avoid a conversation, not to be fair.",
        "73% of startups split equity within the first month of founding. Teams that default to an equal split are ~3x more likely to be unhappy with it later. (Wasserman, 'The Founder's Dilemmas')",
    ),
    "vesting": (
        "VESTING & DEAD EQUITY",
        "Always vesting. Always a cliff. Always a lawyer on the founder agreement.",
        "A co-founder who leaves in month 9 without vesting keeps everything — 'dead equity' that kills investor interest or costs a treasury-sized buyout. Standard fix: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff. Bonus trap: miss the 30-day IRS 83(b) window and get taxed on paper gains forever.",
    ),
    "partnership": (
        "THE PARTNERSHIP TRAP",
        "If your DAO has no legal wrapper, YOU are the legal wrapper.",
        "CFTC v. Ooki DAO: an unincorporated DAO was ruled a general partnership — members were served through the website's help chat box. Default judgment: $634,542 penalty. Sarcuni v. bZx reached the same theory. A ~$15k legal wrapper is cheap insurance.",
    ),
    "death_spiral": (
        "TREASURY DEATH SPIRAL",
        "A treasury that's 90% your own token is a bet that you'll never have a bad month.",
        "When trouble hits, the native token crashes exactly when cash is needed; selling to raise cash crashes it further. Research fix: the barbell — keep 30–50% in uncorrelated stables and pay the boring swap fees.",
    ),
    "recoupment": (
        "PREDATORY RECOUPMENT",
        "An advance is a loan you repay at 10–20 cents on the dollar.",
        "360 deals take cuts of touring and merch the label didn't build. Cross-collateralization ties Album A's debt to Album B's profits — a permanent debt trap dressed as support.",
    ),
    "chargeback": (
        "CHARGEBACK DEATH SPIRAL",
        "Your payment processor is a partner with a 1% tolerance for your mistakes.",
        "Past roughly a 1% chargeback rate, Stripe/PayPal freeze or terminate the account — locking the WHOLE treasury, not just disputed orders. Proactive refunds beat fighting disputes.",
    ),
    "overfunding": (
        "THE OVERFUNDING PARADOX",
        "Overfunding isn't free money — it's unplanned scale on a fixed-price promise.",
        "Coolest Cooler (2014): $50k goal, $13.2M raised, 62,000 backers at $185 — below true at-scale unit cost. Sold at retail for $499 before fulfilling backers. Bankruptcy; 20,000+ backers never got one.",
    ),
    "apathy": (
        "VOTER APATHY & DELEGATION",
        "A governance system nobody uses is an attack surface, not a democracy.",
        "Average DAO turnout: ~6.3%. The usual fix, delegation, quietly re-centralizes: the top 10% of voters ends up controlling up to 76.2% of voting power — a board of directors with no fiduciary duty.",
    ),
    "capture": (
        "GOVERNANCE CAPTURE",
        "If votes can be bought, someone is pricing your treasury.",
        "Build Finance DAO (2022): an attacker accumulated tokens, passed a malicious mint on a low-turnout retry, minted 1B+ tokens and drained ~160 ETH (~$470k). Capture doesn't look like a heist. It looks like help.",
    ),
    "flashloan": (
        "FLASH LOANS & TIME-LOCKS",
        "Any governance path that executes instantly will eventually execute an attack instantly.",
        "Beanstalk (2022, $181M): a flash-borrowed voting supermajority passed a Trojan proposal and executed it in the same transaction via an emergency path — paired with a charity proposal as the distraction. A non-zero delay between vote and execution would have stopped it cold.",
    ),
    "credentials": (
        "CREDENTIAL HYGIENE",
        "A seed phrase in a shared doc is already stolen — you just don't know by whom yet.",
        "8ight Finance lost $1.75M after private keys were pasted into a shared Google Doc and sent over Facebook group chat. Keep 5–10% max in hot wallets; multi-sig cold storage above ~$10k.",
    ),
    "verify_hex": (
        "VERIFY THE HEX",
        "The hardware wallet's ugly little screen is the only screen that isn't lying to you.",
        "Nexus Mutual's founder lost $8M (370,000 NXM) in Dec 2020 to a compromised MetaMask that spoofed the transaction summary. The true destination was on the hardware wallet screen the whole time — unchecked.",
    ),
    "ice_phishing": (
        "ICE PHISHING",
        "Your front end is part of your smart contract.",
        "Badger DAO (2021, $121M): a stolen Cloudflare API key let attackers inject a script into the site that harvested token approvals from users. No contract bug required. DNS, CDN and API keys are security boundaries.",
    ),
    "burnout": (
        "BURNOUT & IDENTITY FUSION",
        "You are not the venture. If it must die, it should not take you with it.",
        "Solopreneur failure research: identity-venture fusion turns stagnation into personal failure and blocks rational pivots. Exhaustion measurably degrades decisions — which is why this game's hints stop being trustworthy when your Burnout is high.",
    ),
    "greenwash": (
        "THE GREENWASHING TRAP",
        "Verify the physical asset before you financialize it.",
        "KlimaDAO/Toucan: 'sweeping the floor' of cheap carbon credits revived worthless legacy offsets (2011-era hydro dams). Scientists and registries disavowed the pools; price and trust collapsed together.",
    ),
