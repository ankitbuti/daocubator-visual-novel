# Glossary — a collectible dictionary of business / crypto / DeFi / DAO jargon.
# vault: 01 Overview/Game Systems.md (Glossary & Plain Mode)
#
# How terms unlock (progress is persistent — it carries across playthroughs):
#   1. STORY — a term appears in dialogue, a menu choice, or a Lesson popup.
#      say_menu_text_filter wraps matches in {a=gloss:id} links; the character
#      callback unlocks them when the line is actually shown (the filter itself
#      must stay pure: Ren'Py also runs it during prediction and lint).
#   2. LINK — glossary entries link to each other. Following a ◇ link to an
#      undiscovered entry unlocks it. Some terms are ONLY reachable this way.
#
# Entry body markup:  <id>  or  <id|display text>   (converted to {a=gloss:id}).
# `match` = regex fragments (case-insensitive, word-bounded) that find the term
# in story text. Check data + reachability with:  python scripts/check_glossary.py
